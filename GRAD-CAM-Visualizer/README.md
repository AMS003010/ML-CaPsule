### Overview

#### What is the Xception model
The Xception model, short for "Extreme Inception," is a deep convolutional neural network architecture. Xception builds upon the Inception architecture but replaces the standard Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions.

#### What is GRAD-CAM
GRAD-CAM, which stands for Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, is a technique used in the field of computer vision to visualize the regions of an image that are important for a convolutional neural network's decision-making process. So GRAD-CAM can be used to explain why the Xception model is classifying that as an "Persian cat" ( Or anything else ) visually through a heatmap.
